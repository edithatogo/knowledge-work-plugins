# Health Core Track Specification

## Overview

Foundation track for the health plugin ecosystem. Creates the plugin skeleton, shared infrastructure, and connector configuration that all other health tracks will build upon.

## Deliverable

A minimal but complete plugin structure that:
- Installs successfully via Claude Code
- Provides connector templates for healthcare tools
- Documents the overall health plugin vision
- Establishes patterns for other tracks to follow

## Components

### File Structure
```
health/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json          # Plugin manifest
├── .mcp.json                # Connector configurations
├── README.md                # Plugin overview
└── CONNECTORS.md            # Connector documentation
```

### plugin.json

- Description: Healthcare organization workflows
- Dependencies: None

### .mcp.json
Template connectors for:
- Document storage (SharePoint, Box, Egnyte)
- Issue tracking (Jira, ServiceNow)
- Clinical systems (placeholder for TBD integrations)

### README.md
- Plugin purpose and scope
- Available skills/commands (placeholder list)
- Installation instructions
- Customization guidance

### CONNECTORS.md
- Connector categories
- Setup instructions per connector
- Authentication requirements
- Troubleshooting

## Success Criteria
