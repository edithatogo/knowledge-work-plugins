# Grant Writer

A comprehensive framework for health research grant application preparation, supporting researchers and institutions in navigating the complex landscape of major Australasian and international funding bodies. This skill provides structured guidance for proposal development, assessment criteria alignment, and strategic positioning to maximize funding success.

**Important**: This skill assists with grant preparation but does not guarantee funding success. Always verify current funder guidelines and deadlines directly with the funding body. Peer review and institutional approval are essential before submission.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when:
- Planning a new grant application for health research funding.
- Selecting the appropriate funder and scheme for your research idea.
- Structuring a research proposal to meet specific funder requirements.
- Aligning your application with assessment criteria and scoring rubrics.
- Developing budget justifications and resource plans.
- Writing Chief Investigator (CI) track record statements.
- Preparing responses to reviewer feedback on resubmissions.
- Converting a research concept into a fundable proposal.
- Navigating compliance requirements for human/animal research ethics.
- Coordinating multi-site or multi-institutional grant applications.

## Regulatory Context

## Quick Reference

1. **Funder Selection**: Match research type, career stage, and institutional capacity.
2. **Scheme Alignment**: Understand eligibility, duration, budget caps, and assessment criteria.
3. **Research Question**: Clear, answerable, significant, and feasible within the budget/timeline.
4. **Significance**: Articulate knowledge gap, innovation, and impact pathways.
5. **Approach**: Rigorous methodology with contingency plans and risk mitigation.
6. **Team**: Appropriate expertise, track record, and demonstrated collaboration.
7. **Environment**: Institutional support, infrastructure, and resources.
8. **Budget**: Realistic, justified, and compliant with funder rules.
9. **Consumer Involvement**: Patient/public engagement where required or beneficial.
10. **Ethics**: Proactive planning for human/animal research approvals.

## Operating Modes

### Standard Mode
Full grant development workflow with comprehensive assessment criteria analysis, detailed budget justification, full CI track record documentation, consumer involvement planning, and complete compliance verification. Use for major scheme applications (NHMRC Ideas/Investigator/Synergy, MRFF large grants, HRC program grants) where funding success is critical and adequate preparation time is available.

### Lite Mode
Streamlined guidance for rapid grant preparation or straightforward fellowship/seed grant applications. Focuses on core proposal elements, basic budget justification, and essential compliance. Never suppresses high-risk requirements such as human research ethics approval or mandatory consumer involvement. Use when timeline is compressed or for lower-complexity applications.

## Detailed Guidance

### 1. Funder and Scheme Selection

Selecting the right funding opportunity is the foundation of grant success. Consider these dimensions:

#### Research Type Alignment

| Funder | Research Focus | Typical Award Size | Duration |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|----------|

| **NHMRC Investigator** | Researcher-led program | $500K-$3M | 5 years |
| **NHMRC Synergy** | Team-based, interdisciplinary | $2M-$5M | 5 years |
| **MRFF** | Mission-driven, translational | $500K-$10M+ | 2-5 years |
| **HRC Explorer** | NZ exploratory research | $150K-$300K | 3 years |
| **HRC Programme** | NZ large team programs | $1M-$5M | 4-5 years |
| **ARC DP** | Basic research excellence | $300K-$500K | 3-5 years |
| **NIH R01** | US investigator-initiated | $1M-$2.5M | 4-5 years |

#### Career Stage Considerations

**Early Career Researchers (ECRs)**:

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Instead |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Vague research question** | Unclear scope makes methodology and assessment impossible | Define specific, answerable aims with clear hypotheses or objectives |
| **Ignoring assessment criteria** | Misalignment with scoring rubric guarantees poor scores | Structure proposal explicitly around stated criteria with equal weighting |
| **Insufficient methodology detail** | Reviewers cannot assess rigor or feasibility | Provide specifics on sample size, analysis plan, and procedures |
| **Unjustified budget** | Appears unrealistic or inflated | Every line item needs justification tied to research activities |
| **Tokenistic consumer involvement** | MRFF requires meaningful engagement; superficial plans are rejected | Define specific consumer roles and budget for fair compensation |
| **Overpromising outcomes** | Unrealistic timelines or deliverables damage credibility | Build in realistic contingencies and acknowledge limitations |
| **Weak track record framing** | Fails to demonstrate capability to deliver | Connect past achievements directly to proposed research requirements |
| **Ignoring funder priorities** | Generic proposals lack competitive edge | Explicitly address how research aligns with scheme goals and priorities |
| **Missing compliance elements** | Ethics, governance, or data management gaps can disqualify | Include all mandatory documentation and address compliance proactively |
| **Poor editing and formatting** | Unprofessional presentation undermines credibility | Follow funder formatting exactly; proofread meticulously |

## When to Escalate

Escalate to Research Office or Chief Investigator when:
- Application involves multiple institutions requiring complex subcontracts.
- Budget exceeds institutional authority or requires special approvals.
- Research involves high-risk activities (gene therapy, dangerous substances).
- Ethics approval is delayed and threatens submission deadline.
- Team disagreements arise about proposal direction or credit allocation.
- Funder guidelines are ambiguous or contradictory.
- Institutional compliance issues emerge (conflict of interest, eligibility questions).
- Submission deadline is at risk due to system issues or administrative delays.

## Privacy Considerations

- **PHI Involved**: Grant applications typically do not include patient-level data.
- **Personnel Information**: CVs and track records contain personal information—handle securely.
- **Institutional Data**: Budget and contract information is sensitive—limit access to team.
- **Consumer Information**: Consumer involvement plans include personal details—protect accordingly.
- **No Persistence**: Do not store draft applications or personal information in temporary workspaces beyond session needs.
- **Access Controls**: Limit grant file access to named investigators and research administrators.

## Confidence Indicators

| Scenario | Confidence | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Standard NHMRC Ideas Grant with clear research question and experienced team | High | Proceed with full development; schedule peer review |
| Complex multi-site MRFF application with industry partners | Medium | Engage Research Office early; schedule compliance review |
| ECR first-time CIA with limited track record | Medium | Consider co-CI arrangement with senior mentor; target appropriate scheme |
| Novel methodology without pilot data | Low | Recommend feasibility study first; strengthen preliminary data |
| Application deadline imminent with incomplete compliance | Low | **BLOCKER**: Escalate to Research Office; consider deadline extension or next round |
| Consumer involvement required but not yet engaged | Low | Immediate action needed; consumer engagement takes time |
| International collaboration with subcontract complexities | Medium | Involve contracts team early; clarify IP and governance |
