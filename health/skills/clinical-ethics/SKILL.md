# Clinical Ethics

A comprehensive framework for clinical ethics consultation, case analysis, and ethical decision-making in healthcare. This skill supports clinicians, ethics committees, and healthcare organizations in navigating complex bioethical dilemmas, facilitating difficult conversations, and reaching ethically defensible decisions in patient care.

**Important**: This skill assists with clinical ethics analysis but does not replace institutional ethics committee authority, legal advice, or clinical judgment. Escalate to institutional resources when patient safety or significant ethical conflicts arise.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when:
- Requesting or conducting a clinical ethics consultation.
- Analyzing an ethical dilemma in patient care (autonomy, beneficence, justice, non-maleficence).
- Preparing for an ethics committee review of a clinical case.
- Facilitating family conferences about treatment goals and end-of-life decisions.
- Addressing conflicts between patients, families, and care teams.
- Navigating surrogate decision-making when patients lack capacity.
- Resolving resource allocation or distributive justice questions.
- Managing conflicts of interest in clinical care.
- Addressing cultural or religious values affecting treatment decisions.
- Developing or revising organizational ethics policies.
- Conducting ethics education for clinical staff.
- Retrospective case review for organizational learning.

2. **Process Matters**: Fair process is as important as right outcome.
3. **Capacity First**: Establish decision-making capacity before proceeding.
4. **Substituted Judgment**: What would the patient want? (not what others want).
5. **Best Interests**: When wishes unknown, use objective standard.
6. **Family Conference**: Structured communication prevents conflict.
7. **Document Everything**: Decisions and rationale must be recorded.
8. **Time-Limited Trials**: When prognosis uncertain, trial interventions first.

10. **Care Continues**: Even when treatment declines, comfort care continues.

## Operating Modes

### Standard Mode
Full clinical ethics consultation workflow with comprehensive case analysis, stakeholder interviews, family conference facilitation, formal recommendations, and follow-up. Use for complex cases involving multiple stakeholders, significant value conflicts, end-of-life decisions, or when there's risk of legal challenge. Includes ethics committee preparation and formal documentation.

### Lite Mode
Streamlined ethical guidance for routine dilemmas or urgent situations requiring rapid decision-making. Focuses on core principles, quick stakeholder consultation, and abbreviated documentation. Never suppresses high-risk escalation requirements, mandatory reporting obligations, or cases involving significant conflict of interest.

## Detailed Guidance

### 1. Clinical Ethics Consultation Request

#### Request Intake Process

**Information to Gather**:
- Patient demographics and clinical status.
- Nature of the ethical dilemma or conflict.
- Stakeholders involved (patient, family, care team, administration).
- Urgency level (emergency, urgent, routine).
- Previous attempts to resolve the issue.
- Relevant clinical history and prognosis.
- Legal or regulatory dimensions.

**Urgency Assessment**:

| Level | Timeline | Examples |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Emergency** | Immediate (<2 hours) | Acute treatment refusal; imminent death; life-threatening conflict |
| **Urgent** | 24-48 hours | Evolving clinical situation; family conflict; discharge planning |
| **Routine** | 3-5 days | Policy question; retrospective review; education request |
| **Non-clinical** | 1-2 weeks | Organizational ethics; resource allocation framework |

**Request Types**:
- **Information**: Clarify ethical concepts or guidelines.
- **Process Facilitation**: Mediate family conferences or team discussions.
- **Case Analysis**: Comprehensive ethical analysis with recommendations.
- **Policy Development**: Ethics input on organizational policies.
- **Education**: Ethics teaching or case discussion.

#### Initial Case Screening

**Questions to Clarify**:
1. Is this an ethics issue or a clinical disagreement?
2. Are all relevant facts known, or is more information needed?
3. Who are the key stakeholders, and have they been engaged?
4. Is patient capacity established or in question?
5. Are there legal implications requiring legal consultation?
6. Is this a pattern suggesting systemic issues?

**When to Decline or Redirect**:
- Purely clinical disagreement without ethical dimension (redirect to clinical review).
- Request for legal advice (redirect to legal/risk management).
- Matters requiring law enforcement (redirect to security/police).
- Individual seeking personal ethics advice (redirect to pastoral care).

### 2. Ethical Case Analysis Framework

#### The Four-Box Method (Jonsen, Siegler, Winslade)

**Box 1: Medical Indications**
- Patient's medical problem and history.
- Goals of treatment (diagnostic, curative, palliative).
- Likelihood of success (evidence-based assessment).
- Prognosis with and without treatment.
- What are the patient/family hoping to achieve?

**Box 2: Patient Preferences**
- Patient's expressed wishes (oral or written).
- Advance care directive (values, goals, specific instructions).
- Decision-making capacity (assessment required).
- If incapacitated: substituted judgment standard.
- Cultural, religious, or personal values affecting decisions.

**Box 3: Quality of Life**
- Patient's current quality of life.
- Likely quality of life with/without treatment.
- Patient's subjective assessment of quality of life.
- Risks of treatment (burdens vs. benefits).
- "Reasonable person" standard when patient view unknown.

**Box 4: Contextual Features**
- Family dynamics and conflicts.
- Cultural or religious factors.
- Financial considerations.
- Resource availability and allocation.
- Legal or regulatory constraints.
- Conflicts of interest.
- Organizational policies.

#### Analysis Process

**Step 1: Fact-Gathering**
- Review medical record thoroughly.
- Interview treating clinicians.
- Speak with patient (if capacity).
- Interview family/surrogates separately if conflict.
- Identify relevant institutional policies.
- Review applicable law.

**Step 2: Stakeholder Identification**
- Primary: Patient (center of concern).
- Secondary: Family, surrogates, caregivers.
- Tertiary: Healthcare team, institution, society.

**Step 3: Values Clarification**
- What does each stakeholder value?
- Where do values align and conflict?
- Are there hidden values or assumptions?
- What cultural/religious factors are relevant?

**Step 4: Option Generation**
- Brainstorm all possible courses of action.
- Include options suggested by all stakeholders.
- Consider compromise positions.
- Time-limited trial as middle ground.

**Step 5: Ethical Analysis**
- Apply core principles (autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice).
- Consider care ethics (relationships, responsibility).
- Apply professional codes and guidelines.
- Weigh principles when in conflict.

**Step 6: Recommendation Formulation**
- State recommendations clearly.
- Provide ethical rationale.
- Acknowledge uncertainty.
- Offer process recommendations.

### 3. Decision-Making Capacity Assessment

#### Elements of Capacity

| Element | Assessment | Red Flags |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| **Understanding** | Can explain diagnosis, prognosis, options in own words | Unable to describe condition; significant cognitive deficits |
| **Appreciation** | Recognizes information applies to self | Denial inconsistent with reality; delusional beliefs |
| **Reasoning** | Can weigh pros/cons; compare options | Inability to process consequences; impulsive reasoning |
| **Expression of Choice** | Can make and communicate a decision | Vacillation; pressured decisions; communication barriers |

**Capacity is Decision-Specific**: A patient may have capacity for some decisions (routine care) but not others (high-stakes surgery).

#### Capacity Assessment Process

1. **Clinical Evaluation**:
   - Mental status examination.
   - Cognitive screening (MMSE, MoCA if appropriate).
   - Delirium assessment.
   - Psychiatric evaluation if mental illness suspected.

2. **Decision-Specific Inquiry**:
   - "Can you tell me what we've discussed today?"
   - "What are your treatment options?"
   - "What are the benefits and risks of each?"
   - "Why have you decided to [accept/refuse]?"
   - "What could happen if you [accept/refuse]?"

3. **Documentation Requirements**:
   - Specific decision being assessed.
   - Clinical basis for assessment (delirium, dementia, psychiatric illness).
   - How each capacity element was evaluated.
   - Conclusion with clear statement.
   - If lacks capacity: basis for substituted judgment.

#### Capacity Thresholds

| Level | Standard | Typical Situations |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| **Full Capacity** | Meets all elements for specific decision | Routine care decisions |
| **Partial Capacity** | Meets some elements; supported decision-making | Complex decisions with support |
| **Lacks Capacity** | Unable to meet essential elements | Major decisions; high risk |
| **Fluctuating** | Varies with time (e.g., delirium) | Defer to lucid periods |

### 4. Surrogate Decision-Making

#### Hierarchy of Surrogates (AU/NZ)

**New Zealand** (PPPR Act 1988; Code of Rights):
1. Person named in advance directive.
2. Welfare guardian (if appointed).
3. Enduring power of attorney (if welfare provisions).
4. Family member (close relationship; willing and available).
5. Court-appointed (if no suitable family).

**Australia** (varies by state):
1. Person named in advance care directive.
2. Enduring guardian/power of attorney.
3. Statutory health attorney (QLD) or equivalent.
4. Person responsible (close adult relative/spouse).
5. Tribunal-appointed guardian.

#### Standards for Surrogate Decision-Making

**1. Substituted Judgment Standard** (preferred):
- "What would the patient want?"
- Based on patient's values, beliefs, prior statements.
- Documented wishes in advance directive.
- Religious/cultural considerations.
- Not what surrogate wants for patient.

**2. Best Interests Standard** (when wishes unknown):
- Objective assessment of what reasonable person would want.
- Consider:
  - Patient's values (even if specific wishes unknown).
  - Quality of life with/without treatment.
  - Burdens vs. benefits of treatment.
  - Likelihood of achieving treatment goals.
  - Pain and suffering.

#### Common Surrogate Challenges

| Challenge | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Disagreement among family** | Family conference; identify spokesperson; clarify legal hierarchy |
| **Surrogate requests inappropriate treatment** | Clarify substituted judgment vs. personal wishes; ethics consultation |
| **Surrogate refuses beneficial treatment** | Assess if refusal is patient's wish vs. surrogate's preference |
| **Estranged family member emerges** | Clarify legal standing; focus on patient wishes; legal review if contested |
| **No family available** | Court/tribunal appointment; institutional ethics review |

### 5. Family Conference Facilitation

#### Pre-Conference Preparation

**Logistics**:
- Private, comfortable setting.
- Adequate time (45-90 minutes typical).
- All key stakeholders invited (with patient consent).
- Interpreter services if needed.
- Support persons present (social work, chaplaincy).

**Clinical Preparation**:
- Clarify medical facts with treating team.
- Establish prognosis range (best/worst/most likely).
- Identify treatment options and recommendations.
- Anticipate likely questions and concerns.

**Ethics Preparation**:
- Review patient's values and prior statements.
- Identify potential value conflicts.
- Clarify decision-making authority.
- Prepare to explain substituted judgment standard.

#### Conference Structure

**Opening** (5-10 minutes):
- Introductions and roles.
- Purpose of meeting.
- Ground rules (respectful communication; all voices heard).
- Confidentiality parameters.

**Information Sharing** (15-20 minutes):
- Medical update in plain language.
- Prognosis and likely outcomes.
- Treatment options (benefits/burdens).
- Physician recommendation.
- Clarifying questions.

**Values Exploration** (15-20 minutes):
- Patient's prior statements about quality of life.
- Religious/cultural considerations.
- What would the patient want in this situation?
- What would "success" look like from patient's perspective?

**Decision-Making** (15-20 minutes):
- Explore options with family.
- Address disagreements respectfully.
- Work toward consensus when possible.
- Clarify decision-maker if surrogate decision required.
- Time-limited trial if appropriate.

**Closing** (5-10 minutes):
- Summarize decisions made.
- Clarify next steps.
- Offer continued support.
- Document discussion.

#### Managing Conflict in Conferences

**De-escalation Techniques**:
- Acknowledge emotions: "I can see this is really difficult."
- Reframe: "We all want what's best for [patient name]."
- Break: Suggest brief pause if emotions high.
- Separate: Meet with factions separately if needed.
- Refocus: Return to patient-centered focus.

**When Consensus Cannot Be Reached**:
- Clarify who has legal decision-making authority.
- Offer additional time for reflection.
- Suggest second opinion.
- Consider ethics consultation/mediation.
- Legal consultation if necessary.

### 6. End-of-Life Ethics

#### Withholding vs. Withdrawing Treatment

**Ethical Equivalence**: Withholding and withdrawing are ethically equivalent. The decision to start or stop should be based on the same criteria (burdens vs. benefits; patient wishes).

**Practical Difference**: 
- Withdrawing may feel more emotionally difficult.
- May require more explicit family consent/understanding.
- Legal protections generally apply equally.

#### Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR/DNR)

**Key Principles**:
- Patient/surrogate has right to refuse CPR.
- DNAR does not mean "do not treat."
- Other life-sustaining treatments continue unless specified otherwise.
- Should be reviewed regularly and with clinical changes.

**Documentation**:
- In medical record with rationale.
- Signed by patient or surrogate (varies by jurisdiction).
- Accessible to all clinical staff.
- Form number per institutional policy.

#### Medical Futility

**Definition**: Treatment that:
- Will not achieve intended physiological goal, OR
- Has already failed, OR
- Is extremely unlikely to achieve benefit commensurate with burdens.

**Types**:
- **Physiologic futility**: Treatment cannot achieve physiological effect.
- **Quantitative futility**: Treatment has <1% chance of success.
- **Qualitative futility**: Treatment would not produce acceptable quality of life.

**Process When Futility Claimed**:
1. Second opinion from another clinician.
2. Ethics consultation if family disagrees.
3. Family conference with clear communication.
4. Time-limited trial if appropriate.
5. Transfer to another institution (if family requests).
6. Legal intervention only as last resort.

#### Palliative Sedation

**Indications**: Refractory symptoms (pain, dyspnea, agitation) at end of life.

**Ethical Requirements**:
- Symptom truly refractory to standard measures.
- Patient or surrogate consent.
- Sedation proportionate to symptom (not euthanasia).
- Intent is comfort, not hastening death.
- Documentation of decision-making.

**Legal Protection** (AU/NZ):
- Doctrine of double effect may apply.
- Intent must be clearly therapeutic.
- Proportionality required.

### 7. Resource Allocation and Justice

#### Micro-Allocation (Bedside)

**Individual Patient Level**:
- Triaging ICU beds or specialized treatments.
- Allocation of scarce resources (dialysis, transplant organs).
- Insurance/funding limitations affecting treatment.

**Decision Framework**:
1. Medical urgency and benefit (sickest first? best outcome?).
2. Time on waiting list (first come, first served?).
3. Random allocation (lottery?).
4. Social value judgments (avoid when possible).

**Fair Process Requirements**:
- Publicly defensible criteria.
- Appeals process available.
- Transparency in decision-making.
- Consistent application.

#### Macro-Allocation (Organizational/Societal)

**Policy-Level Questions**:
- How should limited resources be distributed?
- What services should the organization provide?
- How should cost-effectiveness factor into decisions?

**Principles**:
- **Egalitarian**: Equal access for equal need.
- **Utilitarian**: Greatest good for greatest number.
- **Prioritarian**: Give priority to worst off.
- **Market-based**: Ability to pay determines access.

**Healthcare Organization Approach**:
- Clinical ethics committees typically avoid direct resource allocation.
- Focus on fair process rather than specific outcomes.
- Policy development input rather than individual case decisions.

### 8. Ethics Committee Preparation

#### Case Presentation Structure

**Patient Summary** (3-5 minutes):
- Demographics and diagnosis.
- Clinical course to date.
- Current status and prognosis.
- Treatment options.

**Ethical Dilemma** (3-5 minutes):
- Nature of the conflict or question.
- Stakeholders and their positions.
- Relevant values in tension.
- Previous attempts at resolution.

**Analysis** (5-7 minutes):
- Application of four-box method.
- Relevant ethical principles.
- Institutional policies.
- Legal considerations.

**Questions for Committee**:
- Specific questions to address.
- Areas of uncertainty.
- Request for recommendation.

#### Committee Deliberation

**Structured Discussion**:
1. Clarifying questions (medical facts).
2. Values exploration (what matters to patient).
3. Options review (all possible paths).
4. Recommendation formulation.
5. Process recommendations (how to implement).

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Minutes of discussion (de-identified).
- Committee composition (who participated).
- Consensus or vote if divided.
- Recommendations and rationale.
- Follow-up plan.

**Recommendation Types**:
- **Clinical**: Specific treatment recommendations.
- **Procedural**: Process for decision-making.
- **Educational**: Staff or family education needed.
- **Policy**: Systemic issues requiring policy change.

### 9. Special Populations and Situations

#### Pediatric Ethics

**Key Differences from Adult Ethics**:
- Evolving autonomy (assent vs. consent).
- Parental authority (not absolute; can be limited).
- Best interests standard (substituted judgment often impossible).
- Longer time horizon (implications for quality of life).

**Assent Process**:
- Age-appropriate information sharing.
- Opportunity to assent or dissent.
- Dissent should be seriously considered (not always determinative).
- Documentation of child's views.

**Limits on Parental Authority**:
- Refusal of life-saving treatment.
- Requests for non-beneficial treatment.
- Religious objections to essential care.
- State intervention (child protection).

#### Maternal-Fetal Conflict

**Ethical Framework**:
- Pregnant woman has right to refuse treatment.
- Fetal interests considered but do not override maternal autonomy.
- Intervention requires maternal consent (with rare exceptions).
- Court-ordered cesarean generally not ethically justified.

**Common Scenarios**:
- Refusal of cesarean for fetal indication.
- Substance use during pregnancy.
- Refusal of blood products.
- Psychiatric treatment during pregnancy.

#### Cultural and Religious Considerations

**Approach**:
- Respect for cultural differences (not moral relativism).
- Cultural consultation/interpreter services.
- Religious leader involvement (with consent).
- Negotiation within ethical boundaries.
- Limits: Cannot violate fundamental patient rights.

**Common Religious Considerations**:
- Jehovah's Witnesses and blood products.
- Orthodox Judaism and Sabbath/holidays.
- Islam and modesty requirements.
- Hinduism and Ayurvedic medicine integration.
- Māori tikanga (NZ) and whānau decision-making.

#### Organizational Ethics

**System-Level Issues**:
- Mission alignment of business decisions.
- Conflicts of interest in clinical practice.
- Marketing and advertising ethics.
- Community benefit obligations.
- Staff moral distress.

**Ethics Committee Role**:
- Policy development and review.
- Ethics education.
- Culture of ethical practice.
- Whistleblower protection.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Instead |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Conflating clinical disagreement with ethics conflict** | Wastes ethics resources; delays appropriate resolution | Distinguish clinical (what's medically appropriate) from ethical (what's right given values) |
| **Assuming family speaks for patient** | May not reflect patient's wishes; surrogate authority has limits | Verify surrogate status; apply substituted judgment standard; assess for conflicts |
| **Focusing on outcome over process** | Process violations undermine legitimacy; outcomes may be uncertain | Ensure fair process; transparent decision-making; stakeholder voice |
| **Neglecting capacity assessment** | Invalid consent; potential assault/battery liability | Assess capacity for each significant decision; document thoroughly |
| **Therapeutic misconception in surrogate decisions** | Surrogate conflates what's possible with what's desirable | Clarify prognosis; distinguish treatment from benefit; explore patient values |
| **Rushing end-of-life decisions** | Insufficient time for grieving; decisions may be reactive | Allow time for processing; offer time-limited trials; multiple conversations |
| **Imposing clinician values** | Violates patient autonomy; paternalism | Elicit patient values; bracket own values; facilitate patient-centered decision |
| **Ignoring cultural context** | Cultural insensitivity; missed values | Cultural consultation; interpreter services; respectful curiosity |
| **Inadequate documentation** | Cannot demonstrate rationale; legal vulnerability | Document analysis; values considered; decision-making process |
| **Not involving ethics early** | Conflict escalates; positions harden | Early consultation for emerging conflicts; prevention over crisis management |

## When to Escalate

Escalate to Chief Medical Officer, Ethics Committee Chair, or Legal/Risk Management when:

- Potential for immediate patient harm or death.
- Legal issues requiring counsel (court orders, guardianship).
- Child protection concerns (suspected abuse/neglect).
- Media or public interest in the case.
- High-profile patient or circumstances.
- Significant institutional resource allocation.
- Criminal activity suspected (e.g., poisoning).
- Serious conflict of interest identified.
- Staff refusal to participate in care.
- Patient or family threat of litigation.
- Inability to reach resolution after ethics involvement.

## Privacy Considerations

- **PHI Involved**: Yes - Clinical ethics consultation involves identifiable patient information.
- **Minimum Necessary**: Share only information needed for ethical analysis.
- **Consent for Consultation**: Generally not required for internal ethics consultation (part of care).
- **De-identification**: Ethics committee minutes and records should be de-identified.
- **Access**: Ethics consultation records part of medical record; ethics committee files confidential.
- **Family Information**: Balance transparency with patient privacy (patient consent required).
- **No Persistence**: Do not store identifiable patient details in temporary workspaces.
- **Research Use**: Case studies for education require de-identification and often ethics approval.

## Confidence Indicators

| Scenario | Confidence | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Clear advance directive with straightforward clinical situation | High | Facilitate implementation; support family in honoring wishes |
| Family consensus with clear substituted judgment | High | Document decision-making; proceed with care plan |
| Minor disagreement among family members with shared values | Medium | Family conference; facilitated discussion; usually resolvable |
| Conflict between patient/surrogate and care team | Medium | Ethics consultation; mediation; time-limited trials |
| No surrogate and patient lacks capacity | Low | **BLOCKER**: Legal consultation; guardianship/tribunal process required |
| Suspected elder abuse influencing decisions | Low | **BLOCKER**: Report to adult protective services; legal consultation |
| Parental refusal of life-saving treatment for child | Low | **BLOCKER**: Child protection notification; legal intervention likely required |
| Cultural/religious beliefs conflicting with standard care | Medium | Cultural consultation; explore accommodation options; legal review if necessary |
| Severe family dysfunction with multiple surrogates claiming authority | Low | Legal clarification of authority; ethics facilitation; may need court |
| Treatment futility claim with family disagreement | Medium | Second opinion; ethics consultation; time-limited trial; legal as last resort |
| End-of-life decision with unclear patient wishes | Medium | Substituted judgment inquiry; best interests analysis; family conference |
