# Medicolegal Reports

A comprehensive framework for drafting medico-legal reports that meet legal admissibility standards across Australian, New Zealand, US, and EU jurisdictions. This skill supports clinicians in preparing expert witness reports, independent medical examinations, and court-directed medical assessments with appropriate evidentiary rigor.

**Critical Warning**: Medico-legal reports may be used as evidence in legal proceedings. Accuracy, objectivity, and adherence to jurisdictional requirements are paramount. This skill assists with structure and guidance but does not replace professional legal advice or clinical judgment.

- Drafting independent medical examination (IME) reports for personal injury claims
- Preparing expert witness statements for court proceedings
- Writing workers compensation medical assessments
- Conducting capacity assessments for guardianship or power of attorney
- Preparing forensic medical reports (assault, sexual assault, injury documentation)
- Drafting coronial reports for reportable deaths
- Responding to subpoenas or court orders for medical records
- Providing medical opinions for insurance or litigation purposes
- Writing statutory medical certificates or impairment assessments

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Instead |
|---------|----------------|---------|

| **Using therapeutic relationship for expert opinion** | Dual roles create conflict; therapeutic bias | Separate treating and expert roles; decline if conflict exists |
| **Speculating without foundation** | Speculative opinions lack evidentiary basis | Only offer opinions with stated foundation; express appropriate uncertainty |
| **Ignoring jurisdictional requirements** | Report may be rejected or require revision | Follow applicable court rules or statutory guidelines precisely |
| **Poor documentation of examination** | Unable to defend opinions under cross-examination | Detailed contemporaneous notes; clear examination documentation |
| **Failing to update on new information** | Report may be incomplete or inaccurate | Update report if new material information becomes available |

## When to Escalate

Escalate to legal counsel, medical defense organization, or institutional legal team when:
- Potential conflict of interest identified that cannot be managed
- Report may expose you to professional liability or disciplinary action
- Jurisdictional requirements are unclear or complex
- Case involves novel legal or medical issues outside your experience
- You become aware of information suggesting perjury or fraud by a party
- Subject of report expresses intent to self-harm or harm others
- Subpoena or court order appears invalid or beyond scope of authority
- Report involves cross-border jurisdiction with conflicting requirements
- You are asked to provide opinion outside your area of expertise

## Privacy Considerations

- **PHI Involved**: Yes - Medico-legal reports contain detailed personal health information
- **Data Minimization**: Include only information necessary for the specific legal purpose
- **De-identification**: Not typically appropriate for expert reports (identification required), but consider redaction for third-party distribution
- **Access Controls**: Limit distribution to parties with legitimate legal interest
- **Retention**: Retain records according to legal and professional requirements (typically 7+ years)
- **Secure Transmission**: Use secure methods for report transmission (encrypted email, secure portals)
- **No Persistence**: Do not store PHI in temporary workspaces or chat history beyond necessary processing time

## Confidence Indicators

| Scenario | Confidence | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Clear facts, straightforward causation, within expertise | High | Proceed with standard report preparation |
| Complex causation but good documentation available | Medium | Document reasoning carefully; consider literature review |
| Novel or borderline legal issues | Medium | Consult with legal counsel or experienced colleagues |
| Potential conflict of interest | Low | **BLOCKER**: Disclose immediately; may need to decline instruction |
| Information suggesting perjury or fraud | Low | **BLOCKER**: Escalate to legal counsel; do not participate |
| Request to opine outside expertise | Low | **BLOCKER**: Decline; suggest appropriate expert |
| Subject expresses imminent risk to self/others | Low | **BLOCKER**: Immediate safety protocols; may override confidentiality |
| Ambiguous jurisdiction or procedural requirements | Medium | Seek clarification from instructing solicitor |
| High-stakes litigation with substantial consequences | Medium | Consider peer review of report before finalization |
