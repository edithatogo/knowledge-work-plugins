# Child Protection Reporting

A comprehensive framework for child protection reporting and risk assessment, supporting healthcare professionals in meeting mandatory reporting obligations while maintaining therapeutic relationships and child-centered practice. This skill addresses the legal, ethical, and clinical complexities of child protection work across Australian, New Zealand, US, and EU jurisdictions.

**Critical Warning**: Child protection reporting involves legal obligations that vary by jurisdiction. Failure to report suspected child abuse or neglect may constitute a criminal offense in many jurisdictions. This skill provides guidance but does not replace jurisdiction-specific legal advice or organizational policies.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when:
- Identifying potential indicators of child abuse, neglect, or harm
- Preparing mandatory reports under child protection legislation
- Conducting forensic medical examinations for suspected child abuse
- Writing statutory notifications to child protection authorities
- Assessing risk and protective factors for children in vulnerable situations
- Documenting disclosures of abuse or neglect by children
- Responding to child protection concerns raised by others
- Preparing reports for child protection case conferences or court proceedings
- Navigating confidentiality conflicts between child welfare and family privacy

## Detailed Guidance

### 1. Immediate Safety Assessment

#### Step 1: Triage
- **Immediate Danger**: Is the child in immediate danger of serious harm?
- **Medical Priority**: Does the child need urgent medical treatment?
- **Placement**: Is the child safe to return home?

#### Step 2: Immediate Actions
- **Medical Needs**: Treat urgent medical conditions first
- **Safety Planning**: If child not safe to return home, discuss with child protection
- **Evidence Preservation**: Photograph visible injuries; collect specimens before washing
- **Documentation**: Record exact words used by child; do not paraphrase

#### Step 3: Consultation
- **Senior Clinician**: Consult with senior colleague or child protection team
- **Child Protection**: Contact child protection services for urgent cases
- **Police**: For criminal matters (sexual abuse, serious physical abuse)
- **Legal**: For complex confidentiality or consent issues

### 2. Documentation Requirements

#### Contemporaneous Notes (CRITICAL)
- **Date and Time**: When disclosure was made or concerns identified
- **Exact Words**: Record child's exact words in quotation marks
- **Context**: Who was present; how disclosure came about
- **Non-Verbal**: Child's affect, behavior, body language

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Instead |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Delaying report to gather more information** | Child may remain at risk during delay; may lose forensic evidence | Report immediately based on current concerns; further information can be added later |
| **Paraphrasing child's words** | Changes meaning; may be inadmissible; loses impact | Record child's exact words in quotation marks |
| **Promising confidentiality you cannot keep** | Breaches trust; may inhibit future disclosures | Explain mandatory reporting obligations upfront |
| **Leading questions in interview** | Contaminates evidence; child may acquiesce | Use open-ended questions; "Tell me what happened" |
| **Conducting detailed forensic interview** | May compromise evidence; outside clinical role | Document what child volunteers; refer to specialist interviewers |
| **Not documenting non-verbal behavior** | Important context is lost | Document affect, behavior, body language |
| **Failing to consider cultural context** | Misinterprets normal cultural practices as abuse | Consult with cultural advisors; consider cultural background |
| **Making diagnoses without evidence** | Opinions may be challenged; inappropriate certainty | Describe observed indicators; express appropriate uncertainty |
| **Not following up on report** | Child may fall through cracks; lose opportunity to support | Track report outcomes; remain engaged in care |
| **Vicarious trauma without support** | Impairs clinical judgment; leads to burnout | Seek peer support; utilize supervision; practice self-care |

## When to Escalate

Escalate immediately to senior clinician, child protection services, or police when:
- Child discloses ongoing sexual abuse or severe physical abuse
- Child is in immediate danger and cannot be protected
- Parent threatens violence toward child or staff
- Multiple agencies involved with conflicting recommendations
- Suspected fabricated or induced illness (Munchausen by proxy)
- Serious criminal matters (sexual abuse, serious assault, child homicide)
- Child expresses suicidal intent or self-harm
- Reported matter involves institutional abuse
- Jurisdictional issues (interstate or international child protection matters)
- You are uncertain about mandatory reporting threshold

## Privacy Considerations

- **PHI Involved**: Yes - Child protection reports contain highly sensitive personal and health information
- **Data Minimization**: Include only information necessary for child protection assessment
- **Secure Transmission**: Use secure reporting portals or encrypted communication
- **Access Controls**: Limit access to those with legitimate child protection role
- **Retention**: Maintain records according to child protection legislation and organizational policy (typically until child reaches 25 years)
- **Cross-Border**: Special considerations for international child protection matters
- **No Persistence**: Do not store sensitive child protection information in temporary workspaces

## Confidence Indicators

| Scenario | Confidence | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Clear disclosure from child; consistent history | High | Report immediately; ensure safety; document thoroughly |
| Multiple indicators but no direct disclosure | Medium | Consult with senior; gather collateral information; likely report |
| Single concerning indicator; may be innocent | Medium | Monitor closely; consult with senior; document carefully |
| Uncertain about threshold for reporting | Medium | **ALWAYS REPORT** when in doubt; better safe than sorry |
| Child requests confidentiality; safety concerns | Low | **BLOCKER**: Mandatory reporting obligation overrides confidentiality |
| Suspected serious abuse (sexual, severe physical) | High | Immediate report to child protection AND police |
| Fabricated illness suspected | Low | **BLOCKER**: Requires specialist assessment; involve senior clinicians |
| Cultural practices being misinterpreted | Medium | Consult with cultural advisors; ensure cultural safety |
