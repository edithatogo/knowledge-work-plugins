## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Instead |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Including legal arguments** | Affidavits are for facts, not legal submissions | Present facts objectively; let lawyers make legal arguments |
| **Drawing legal conclusions** | Deponent not qualified to draw legal conclusions | State facts and expert opinions within expertise; e.g., "breach of duty" not appropriate |
| **Failing to distinguish personal knowledge** | May be challenged as inadmissible hearsay | Clearly label personal knowledge vs. information and belief |
| **Improper exhibit labeling** | May cause exhibits to be rejected | Follow court rules precisely for exhibit marking |
| **Swearing incomplete draft** | Cannot amend after swearing without explanation | Ensure affidavit is complete and accurate before swearing |
| **Using wrong jurat form** | Affidavit may be invalid | Use oath or affirmation as appropriate; follow jurisdiction requirements |
| **Unauthorized witness** | Affidavit may not be admissible | Ensure witness is authorized for that jurisdiction and court |
| **Speculating without foundation** | Weakens credibility; may be challenged | Only state opinions with proper foundation; express uncertainty appropriately |
| **Contradicting prior statements** | Undermines credibility; potential perjury | Review prior statements; ensure consistency or explain changes |
| **Including irrelevant material** | Weakens impact; wastes court time | Include only relevant facts; attach additional material as exhibits if needed |

## When to Escalate

Escalate to legal counsel, medical defense organization, or senior management when:
- Potential conflict between affidavit and prior statements
- Discovery of error in affidavit after swearing
- Pressure to include statements you believe are untrue
- Uncertainty about jurisdiction-specific requirements
- Complex exhibit management issues
- Cross-border or international enforcement considerations
- Privacy or confidentiality conflicts
- Potential perjury or contempt of court issues
- Significant legal consequences for deponent

## Privacy Considerations

- **PHI Involved**: Yes - Affidavits often contain detailed medical information
- **Court Record**: Affidavits become part of public court record (subject to sealing orders)
- **Data Minimization**: Include only information necessary for legal purpose
- **Redaction**: Consider redaction of sensitive information where appropriate
- **Secure Handling**: Maintain security during drafting and before filing
- **Retention**: Retain drafts and working notes according to legal requirements
- **No Persistence**: Do not store PHI in temporary workspaces

## Confidence Indicators

| Scenario | Confidence | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Clear facts, straightforward affidavit, legal review obtained | High | Proceed with swearing after legal review |
| Complex expert evidence requiring detailed foundation | Medium | Ensure comprehensive foundation; multiple legal reviews |
| Cross-border or international enforcement | Medium | Consult with international law expertise |

| Pressure to include untrue or misleading statements | Low | **BLOCKER**: Refuse; escalate to legal counsel; consider professional advice |
| Uncertain about jurisdiction-specific requirements | Medium | Obtain definitive legal advice before swearing |
