# Manuscript Preparation

A comprehensive framework for preparing healthcare and medical research manuscripts for peer-reviewed journal publication. This skill guides researchers through journal selection, reporting guideline compliance, manuscript structuring, and submission preparation while ensuring adherence to evidence standards and publication ethics.

**Important**: This skill assists with manuscript preparation workflows but does not provide clinical advice, guarantee publication acceptance, or replace the judgment of experienced co-authors and mentors. Always verify journal-specific requirements before submission.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when:
- Planning a manuscript submission for journal publication.
- Selecting appropriate journals based on study type, impact factor, and audience.
- Determining which reporting guideline applies (CONSORT, STROBE, CHEERS, PRISMA, etc.).
- Structuring a manuscript according to journal requirements and study type.
- Preparing figures, tables, and supplementary materials.
- Formatting references according to journal style.
- Writing a compelling cover letter for journal submission.
- Conducting pre-submission checks against journal requirements.
- Responding to peer reviewer comments and preparing revisions.
- Documenting authorship contributions and conflicts of interest.
- Preparing a Data Availability Statement and patient consent documentation.

5. **Structure Matters**: Follow IMRAD format with journal-specific adaptations.
6. **Figures/Tables**: Limit to essential; follow journal guidelines for resolution and format.
7. **References**: Use reference manager; verify journal style requirements.
8. **Cover Letter**: Articulate novelty, significance, and fit for target journal.

13. **Ethics Statement**: Document ethics approval and consent for all human subjects research.
14. **Conflicts**: Disclose all financial and non-financial competing interests.

## Operating Modes

### Standard Mode
Full manuscript preparation workflow with comprehensive reporting guideline compliance, journal-specific formatting requirements, detailed figure/table preparation, reference management, and cover letter drafting. Use for high-impact journal submissions, complex study designs, and first-time authors requiring detailed guidance. Includes authorship documentation, ethics compliance verification, and pre-submission readiness checks.

### Lite Mode
Streamlined guidance for rapid manuscript preparation or experienced authors. Focuses on essential checklist items, basic structure templates, and critical compliance requirements. Never suppresses mandatory reporting obligations (trial registration, ethics approval, conflict disclosure) or high-risk patient privacy requirements. Suitable for brief communications, letters, or internal draft preparation.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Instead |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Ignoring reporting guidelines** | Reviewers and editors reject for non-compliance | Download and complete appropriate checklist from EQUATOR Network before writing |
| **Failing to register clinical trial** | Violates ICMJE requirements; grounds for rejection | Register on ClinicalTrials.gov or ANZCTR before first patient enrollment |
| **Incomplete ethics documentation** | Violates Declaration of Helsinki; publication ethics breach | Include ethics approval number, committee name, and informed consent statement |
| **Self-plagiarism from thesis** | May violate journal originality policies | Disclose thesis origin; seek permission; rewrite substantially |
| **Ghost/guest authorship** | Violates ICMJE authorship criteria; research misconduct | Ensure all authors meet all 4 ICMJE criteria; document contributions |
| **Duplicate publication** | Unethical; distorts evidence base | Cite and cross-reference related publications; seek permission for overlapping content |
| **Selective outcome reporting** | Biases evidence; violates CONSORT | Report all pre-specified outcomes; explain any changes in protocol |
| **Inadequate figure resolution** | Cannot be used for print; delays publication | Provide 300+ DPI TIFF/EPS files; check journal specifications |
| **Unverifiable references** | Undermines credibility; may indicate poor scholarship | Verify all references against original sources; use DOIs |
| **Overstating conclusions** | Misleading readers; damages credibility | Match conclusions to actual results; acknowledge limitations |
| **Missing balancing measures** (QI) | May mask unintended harm | Always report balancing measures in quality improvement studies |
| **Confusing QI with research** | Different ethics and regulatory requirements | Clearly distinguish QI from research; seek ethics review if uncertain |

## When to Escalate

Escalate to senior author, research mentor, or research office when:
- Disputes arise regarding authorship order or inclusion.
- Significant unexpected findings suggest need for additional analyses.
- Adverse events occurred that were not anticipated in ethics approval.
- Data quality issues discovered during manuscript preparation.
- Conflicts of interest are complex or involve significant financial interests.
- Study was not registered as required (potential journal rejection).
- Publisher requests open access fees beyond available budget.
- Peer review identifies major methodological concerns requiring re-analysis.
- Allegations of misconduct or plagiarism arise.
- Human subjects research lacks proper ethics approval documentation.
- Patient identifiable information discovered in de-identified dataset.

## Privacy Considerations

- **PHI Involved**: Yes - manuscripts often include patient-level data (case reports, clinical studies).
- **Data Minimization**: Include only data elements necessary to support findings; aggregate when possible.
- **De-identification**: Remove all 18 HIPAA identifiers or equivalent AU/NZ identifiers; use case numbers instead of initials.
- **Consent for Publication**: Obtain written consent for case reports and any patient images; document in manuscript.
- **Repository Data**: Ensure data repositories for sharing are approved and access-controlled.
- **Retention**: Retain original data and analysis files per institutional policy (typically 7+ years post-publication).
- **No Persistence**: Do not store PHI in temporary workspaces or chat history during manuscript preparation.
- **Image Anonymization**: Verify radiology images have burned-in identifiers removed; crop photographs to exclude identifying features.

## Confidence Indicators

| Scenario | Confidence | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Well-designed RCT with CONSORT compliance, registered, ethics-approved | High | Proceed with standard manuscript preparation; conduct pre-submission checklist |
| Secondary analysis of existing dataset with unclear reporting requirements | Medium | Consult EQUATOR Network for appropriate extension; verify journal requirements |
| Case report without written patient consent | Low | **BLOCKER**: Obtain consent or seek ethics waiver; do not proceed without documentation |
| Study conducted without pre-registration (clinical trial) | Low | Consult research office; consider registry anyway; disclose limitation in manuscript |
| Discrepancy between protocol and reported outcomes | Medium | Flag for team discussion; transparently report protocol changes with rationale |
| Complex multi-site study with governance variations | Medium | Escalate to coordinating center; verify all site approvals documented |
| Unanticipated adverse events discovered in analysis | Low | **BLOCKER**: Escalate to Principal Investigator; may require safety reporting and protocol amendment |
| Questionable image integrity (duplication, manipulation) | Low | **BLOCKER**: Halt submission; verify original images; consult research integrity officer |
| First author with limited publication experience | Medium | Ensure senior author review; use detailed checklists; allow extra time for revision |
